# Hi! I'm an applied mathematician and engineer working on modeling, ML, and data analysis across medicine, human behavior, computation and technology

## About Me

I hold an M.Math in Applied Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, where I developed models for diabetes and virtual kidneys using large scale medical data, and partial differntial equations and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and minor in math from Sharif University of Technology, specializing in control theory and applied mathematics.

I’ve applied the same analytical and engineering toolkit to projects in mental health, finance, and audience measurement.

## Interests

I’m interested in problems that connect mathematical reasoning with real applications.  
Current areas of focus include:

- Computational biology and physiology  
- Mathematical modeling and simulation  
- Machine learning and its reliability  
- Natural language processing  

I’m open to collaborations and projects related to these areas.


## Beyond Math and Technology

Outside of work, I enjoy learning languages, sports, and reading.  
I’m fluent in German, English, Persian, and French.
