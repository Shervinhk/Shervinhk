# Hi, I'm Shervin.

I enjoy using mathematics and machine learning in real-world applications. I have training in both engineering and applied mathematics and have built projects and products in **healthcare**, **computational biology**, **finance**, and **media**. I hold an MMath in Applied Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, a bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology focusing on control theory, and a minor in Mathematics.

## Interests

Iâ€™m interested in all things related to **machine learning** and **building things**. More specifically, I'm passionate about:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Computational Biology**
- **Robustness in Machine Learning**

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on and am open to projects related to the subjects mentioned above.

## Beyond Math and Tech

Outside of math and technology, I enjoy:

- **Linguistics** and **learning new languages** (currently fluent in German, English, Persian, and French)
- **Photography**
- **Reading**
- **Sailing**
