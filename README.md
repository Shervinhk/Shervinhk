-  Hi, Iâ€™m Shervin Hakimi. I'm passionate about mathematics and machine learning and leveraging them in real world applications. I have built projects and products in healthcare, computational biology and finance. I have an MMath in Applied Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, a bachelor's in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology focusing on control theory and a minor in mathematics. 
-  Iâ€™m interested in all things related to ML and building things. More specifically I'm interested in NLP, computational biology, causal inference, and robustness in machine learning.
-  Iâ€™m looking and open to collaborate on projects related to the subjects above
